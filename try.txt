Your essay needs a thesis statement 
Three things to consider before writing your essay:

thesis
type
audience
Of these, the most important by far is your thesis, or the crux of what your essay is about.

Your thesis, encapsulated in your thesis statement, is the central point you‚Äôre trying to make. The thesis of Bertrand Russell‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúIn Praise of Idleness,‚Äù for example, is that people focus too much on work and don‚Äôt value time spent idly. Essays can occasionally stray and go into related tangents, but they always come back to that one core idea in the thesis. 

You should always pinpoint your thesis before writing. If you‚Äôre having trouble nailing it down, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the one thing I want my reader to remember when they‚Äôre done reading my essay?‚Äù

The best practice is to include your thesis as soon as possible, even in your topic sentence if it‚Äôs appropriate. You‚Äôll want to reiterate it throughout the essay as well, especially when wrapping up everything in the conclusion. 

The rest of your essay, then, supports your thesis. You can include empirical evidence, testimonials, logical deductions, or even persuasive rhetoric‚Äîwhatever gets the job done. The point is that you‚Äôre building upon your initial thesis, not switching to completely different topics. 

The essay-writing process
If you‚Äôre writing an essay, research paper, term paper, novel, short story, poem, screenplay, blog article about essay writing‚Äîwhen writing just about anything, really‚Äîit‚Äôs crucial to follow an efficient writing process. Even if you prefer the stream-of-consciousness style for writing your rough draft, you still need to have an orderly system that allows you to revise and hone. 

For essay writing, we recommend this five-step writing process:

1 Brainstorming
It always helps to collect your thoughts before you begin writing by brainstorming. Based on your prompt or thesis, try to generate as many ideas as possible to include in your essay. Think of as many as time allows, knowing that you‚Äôll be able to set aside the ideas that don‚Äôt work later. 

2 Preparing
The preparation phase consists of both outlining your essay and collecting resources for evidence. Take a look at the results of your brainstorming session. First, isolate the ideas that are essential to support your thesis and then organize them in a logical and progressive order. In this stage you‚Äôll incorporate your essay structure, which we explain below.

If you want empirical evidence or complementary citations, track them down now. The way you write citations depends on the style guide you‚Äôre using. The three most common style guides for academics are MLA, APA, and Chicago, and each has its own particular rules and requirements for citing just about any kind of source, including newspaper articles, websites, speeches, and YouTube videos.

3 Drafting
This is the main stage of essay writing where you roll up your sleeves and actually write your first draft. Remember that everything doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect; this is your first draft, not your final draft, so give yourself the freedom to make errors. If you‚Äôre focusing on getting every single word right, you‚Äôll miss the big picture. 

4 Revising
The revisions stage involves your second draft, your third draft, or even your twelfth draft if necessary. Address all the nuances and subtleties you glossed over in the first draft. 

Pay attention to both word choice and clarity, as well as sophisticated writing techniques like avoiding the passive voice. If you‚Äôre not confident in your writing skills yet, the Grammarly Editor ensures your writing is readable, clear, and concise by offering sentence structure and word choice suggestions, plus clarity revisions as you write.

This is also where you can turn to Grammarly‚Äôs AI-powered writing assistant, which helps catch these common mistakes for you. Or copy and paste your writing to check your grammar and get instant feedback on grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other mistakes you might have missed.

Essay structure
Essay structure almost always follows a simple beginning-middle-end format, or in this case, an introduction-body-conclusion format. However, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs contained within those sections that makes all the difference. 

Introduction
Essays follow the same guidelines for introductions as any other piece of writing, with an extra emphasis on presenting the thesis prominently, ideally in the topic sentence. By the end of your introduction paragraph, your reader should know without a doubt what your essay is about. From there, follow the conventional best practices on how to write an introduction. 

Body paragraphs
The majority of your essay is body paragraphs, all of which support your thesis and present evidence. 

Pay close attention to how you organize your body paragraphs. Some arguments benefit from a logical progression, where one point leads to a second, and that second point leads to a third. Remember that the reader doesn‚Äôt understand the topic like you do (that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre writing the essay), so structure your paragraphs in the way that‚Äôs best for their comprehension. 

What if you‚Äôre writing an argumentative essay where you compare and contrast two or more points of view? Do you present your argument first and then share opposing points of view, or do you open with your opposition‚Äôs argument and then refute it? 

Serious writers can get pretty technical about how to organize an argumentative essay. There are three approaches in particular used often: Aristotlian (classical), Rogerian, and Toulmin. However, these can get exceedingly complicated, so for a simple essay, a basic structure will do just fine:

Your point
Counterpoint
Evidence supporting your point and/or disproving counterpoint 
Conclusion
Essay conclusions wrap up or summarize your thesis in a way that‚Äôs easy for the reader to digest. If you get the chance, you can add a new perspective or context for understanding your thesis, but in general the conclusion should not present any new evidence or supporting data. Rather, it‚Äôs more of a recap. For more specific tips, read about how to write a conclusion for an essay here. 

Five-paragraph essay
For quick and simple essays, you don‚Äôt need to get too technical with your essay structure. The five-paragraph essay structure works well in a pinch. This contains:

One introduction paragraph
Three body paragraphs
One conclusion paragraph
While this essay structure might not be flexible enough for more advanced topics, it comes in handy when speed is a factor, like during timed tests. 

Know your essay‚Äôs audience
Your final consideration is who will read your essay‚Äîa teacher, an admissions counselor, your peers, the internet at large, etc. 

No matter what you‚Äôre writing, your audience should influence your language. For one thing, your readers determine whether the essay is formal or casual, which has an enormous impact on language, word choice, and style. Take emojis for example: In a casual essay they might be welcome, but for formal writing they‚Äôre not the most appropriate choice. üòì

Your audience also affects the essay‚Äôs tone, or how you sound on an emotional level (enthusiastic, cautious, confident, etc.). If you‚Äôd like to know more, you can read about the 10 common types of tone here. 

6 types of essays
Like any form of writing, essays come in many different types. Sometimes the assignment dictates the type, as with admissions essays, and other times the thesis will determine it. Regardless, it helps to know what your options are, so here are some of the most common essay types: 

1 Argumentative essay
Argumentative essays assert or defend a position. This is the most common type of school paper, so keep that in mind when writing your first college essay. 

2 Admissions essay
Most colleges request an admissions essay in applications, which typically revolve around why you‚Äôre interested in their school. 

3 Persuasive essay
A persuasive essay is just as it sounds: an essay to persuade or convince the reader of a certain point. It‚Äôs similar to an argumentative essay‚Äî they both strongly favor a particular point of view, but the difference is the end goal: Argumentative essays just have to present their case, while persuasive essays have to present their case and win over the reader. 

4 Compare-and-contrast essay
When you want to devote equal attention to two opposing things, a compare-and-contrast essay works better than argumentative or persuasive essays, which lean to one side over the other.

5 Personal essay
Personal essays are often anecdotal or real-life stories of the authors, like the works of David Sedaris. Because they tend to follow narrative structures, the thesis can be flexible or interpretive. 

6 Expository essay
An expository essay thoroughly explains a certain topic to expand the reader‚Äôs knowledge. It is similar to an argumentative and persuasive essay in format, but with one key difference: expository essays don‚Äôt have a bias. 

Essay writing tips
Master the five fundamentals
Especially for school essays, your reader will scrutinize how well you handle the fundamentals. Knowing about essay structure and the writing process is one thing, but can you demonstrate an understanding of language style? Can you develop your thesis logically and coherently? Are your references and citations trustworthy?

When you‚Äôre ready for the next step of essay writing, take a look at the five concepts you must master to write better essays. The tips there pick up where this guide leaves off. 

Seek out another pair of eyes
This tip is not just for essays; it‚Äôs always advisable to have someone else read over your writing before finalizing it. All too often we miss the forest for the trees, and thinking long and hard on the same topic can give you tunnel vision. The solution is to get a fresh take from someone who‚Äôs seeing it for the first time. 

Typically you can swap with a friend and edit each others‚Äô works. If that‚Äôs not an option, however, you can also use a writing center or join a writing group online. At the very least, you should sleep on it and take another look when you‚Äôre refreshed. 

Remember: Grammar and form are essential 
It‚Äôs not always about what you say, but how you say it. You could have the most obvious, objectively agreeable thesis in the world, but if your writing is incoherent, confusing, and full of mistakes, it‚Äôs tough to engage with your reader. 

For when your writing needs to make the right impact, Grammarly Premium offers full-sentence rewrites for confusing sentences‚Äîfrom splitting long sentences, cutting extra words, or rearranging key phrases‚Äîin addition to catching common grammar mistakes. It also gives you readability-focused formatting suggestions, so you know your writing is clear. It also helps those who are looking to improve their writing skill level in English, with suggestions for commonly misused words and phrases. 

Honing your writing with these elements in mind is key to relaying your point to your reader‚Äîand asserting your thesis as effectively as possible.
